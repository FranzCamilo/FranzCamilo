- 👋 Hi, I’m @FranzCamilo
- 👀 I’m interested in working on software development with C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make professional projects in C++ and improving my C++ skills specially by developing an autonomous project about general matrix manipulation (linear algebra operations).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ projects, specially those that require a good background on math, physics and engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me...
