- 👋 Hi, I’m @FranzCamilo
- 👀 I’m interested in working on software development with C++ and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make professional projects in C++ and Python, improving my coding skills, especially by developing an autonomous project about general matrix manipulation (linear algebra operations) and taking an online course on Python for Data Analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on professional C++ or Python projects, especially those that require a good background on math, physics and engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me: sending an email to devfranzcamilo@gmail.com.
